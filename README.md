# Java_Design_Patterns_MVC_Project
This was my final project in my design patterns course. I built a tutoring sign up website using Java servlets, MySQL  and JPA as the entity manager for my MySQL database

This project requires netbeans with glassfish and derby as well as MySQL database to work properly. 
This project requires nothing but the correct Database and code to run.
